    This Project is on still hold for now, but will be rebooted shortly as work through some ruby tuts.

Welcome to Kitty Party.
This is a self made coding challenge

I am building a kitty party planning app.

This came about as I was trying to think of how i could challenge myself with a coding problem and at the same time my wife was busy on the phone trying to plan a kitty party.  A kitty party is native to India and is pretty much a pot-luck party for mostly stay at home wives.

This is a learning process for me. so use it at your own risk.

As of 4/25/2013  this is on hold as a work / challenge myself on a more difficult Rails app.
